Your job for this assignment is to complete the Bug class by writing accessor, mutator, and toString methods.

Then, run the Main.java file and trace through the code. Make sure you know what each line is doing.

(Each method is worth 2 points. Another 2 points for formatting and comments. Total: 16 points.)
