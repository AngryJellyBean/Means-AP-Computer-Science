For this assignment, you will be working with two arrays. The first array, message, is an array of strings that spell out a secret message when read backward. Create a new string by iterating through message backwards, and print this new string to the screen. (5 pts)

The second array. triangularNumbers, is an integer array with 10 slots. You will need to find the first 10 triangular numbers (from 0 to 9) and put them into this array. The formula for Triangular Numbers can be found here. Then, print the contents of triangularNnumbers. (5pts)

You must use a for loop for both of these tasks. Remember to include comments and proper formatting (2 pts).
