Write a program that accepts an unspecified number of integers from the user (3 pts), determines how many positive and negative values have been entered (3 pts), and computes the total and average of the values that have been entered (excluding zeros) (4 pts). The program should end when the user inputs a zero (2 pts). Remember to use proper formatting and comments (2 pts). (Total: 14 pts)
