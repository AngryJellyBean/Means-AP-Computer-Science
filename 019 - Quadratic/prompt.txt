Given the coefficients of a quadratic equation, determine whether or not the roots of the equation are real or imaginary. If the discriminant evaluates to > 0 then the solution contains 2 real roots. If the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the solution is 1 real root. However, if the discriminant evaluates to a negative number then there are 2 imaginary numbers as solutions. If real roots exist, calculate the real roots and display the proper result. If the solution is imaginary then display “there are no real roots”.

The program should perform the following:

1. Declare and input the first, second, and third coefficient of the equation. (3 pts)
2. Declaration and evaluation of the discriminant (3 pts)
3. Decision structure which properly displays the result of three possible outcomes. (9 pts)
4. Proper formatting and comments (2 pts)

(Total 17 pts)
