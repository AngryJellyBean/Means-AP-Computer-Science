Create a program to let the user practice their multiplication tables. Print a multiplication question using two
random integers between 1 and 12. Then allow the user input an int as their answer to the multiplication of the
two numbers. If they enter the correct product print “Correct!” otherwise print “Wrong”. You must use an else
statement in your code to receive full credit for this exercise.

1. Generate two random integers between 1 and 12. Then multiply them to get an answer. (2 pts)
2. Prompt the user to answer the multiplication problem, and collect an int from the user. (2 pts)
3. Determine if the user has the correct answer, and display whether they were correct. (2 pts)
4. Proper spacing and two comments (2 pts)
