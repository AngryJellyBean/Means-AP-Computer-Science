Write a program that plays the Fizz Buzz game.

Have the user input two positive integers. (4 pts)

Use a For Loop to print out the integers between 1 and 100. HOWEVER, if a number is divisible by the first user input, print “Fizz” instead. If a number is divisible by the second user input, output “Buzz” instead. If a number is divisible by both of the user's integers, then output “Fizz Buzz” instead. (8 pts)

Keep track of how many times “Fizz” was printed and how many times “Buzz” was printed. Print this information after the list of numbers. (4 pts)

Remember to use clean spacing and helpful comments. (2 pts)

(Total: 18 pts)
